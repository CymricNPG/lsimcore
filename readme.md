Lightweight Simulation Core
---------------------------
DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION, THIS IS JUST A PLAYGROUND TO TEST CONCEPTS.

Keywords:

- Discrete Event Simulation
- Small modular simulation core for very specific applications
- Pessimistic Time Management, with very strict lookahead handling
- Separation of events and time management
- Distributed
- Small API
- Few dependency (use Java/Kotlin things)
- Playground for Ideas and new technologies
- No Realtime!
- Parallel execution
